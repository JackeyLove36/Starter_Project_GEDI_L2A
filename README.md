# Starter_Project_GEDI_L2A

This is the starter project for Brown Visual Computing Group with advice from David Laidlaw. This project aims to create the virtual 
reality (VR) visualization of the rh_0 and rh_98 measures from GEDI L2A products. And the general steps for this project are acquiring and processing GEDI L2A products, designing and implementing the visualization with the virtual reality (VR), and finally testing the implementation with the provided VR hardware.
